      <h1>Let's Go To The Movies Project</h1> 
 <body>  
</html>

The project will focus on comparing and contrasting specific attributes from a substantial movie dataset. When you think of movies, often times we only think of going to the movies as a movie-goer. However, there is an entire area of analysis that is beyond just the movie-goer experience. In this study we will focus on evaluating the other attributes of the movie experience. We will consider the following: Movie Rank, Genre, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue and Metascore. Additionally, there will also be an evaluation of the movie-goer experience as well. A small susbest of the entire dataset will be used for this analysis. There will be a more expasive discussion of this evaluation later.

      <h2>Reason for this Research</h2> 
 <body>  
</html>

    This is a requirement for Phase I of the Data Science Fellowship completion. Due: December 2023
In addition, to have a little fun! Often times we as Data Scientists spend a tremendous amount of time researching topics that may not necessarily be interesting to our familes or friends. With this project the goal is to mix research with fun. And possibly uncover some interesting facts about film making, movie goer's, human nature and how world events play a part in even the selection of the movies that we watch. Sound Intersting?

Research Goals
> Goal 1: Comparative Analysis:  To include specific attributes or details provided that can be used in creating the comparative analysis that is necessary.
>
> Attributes
> The Attributes for analysis are: Movie Rank, Genre, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue and Metascore
> 
> Goal 2: TBD


#1. DATA

The data is being furnished by an authored contributor and researcher,Promptcloud from Kaggle. This dataset represents a 10-year history of movies between the years 2006-2016.
The location being accessed is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data?select=IMDB-Movie-Data.csv
Note: The following if for additional information purposes: Several data sources have made this informaiton possible, they are: IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/  and
The Numbers: https://www.the-numbers.com/

#2. METHOD

The primary objective is the begin with clean data. Then place that data into a predictive model. 
1. Linear Regression Model

#3. CLEANING REPORT

TBD

(Add Here: Cleaning Report)
The purpose of this is to present the data in the most unencumbered manner psossible. The data has been cleared of duplicate rows, and columns, NAN, Non-NaN, and Blanks.

#4. EDA

The EDA Analysis Report will be displayed in the following:
(PROVIDE here: Written Analysis of Results)
ALSO... Provide Data Vizualizations (DV)- Per the instructor, DV is not required here.)

#5. MODELING

TBD

1st: Provide Pre-Processing Report Modeling Report
2nd: Provide the Linearn Regression Model Data visualization and written analysis

#7. FURTHER RESEARCH

TBD

(Provide written analysis)

#8. CREDITS

TBD

(Provide written summary)
